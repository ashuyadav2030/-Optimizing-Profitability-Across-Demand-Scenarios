# Supplier Selection Strategy for IKEA's Krusbar Gazebo Tent: Optimizing Profitability Across Demand Scenarios

In this project, IKEA aims to introduce the "Krusbar" gazebo tent, retailing at approximately 150 euros, in the upcoming summer season in Scandinavia. However, the demand for Krusbar is uncertain, with an equal probability of it being either weak or strong. During the weak season, the demand is uniformly distributed between 2,000 and 8,000 units, while in the strong season, it follows a uniform distribution between 6,000 and 14,000 units.

IKEA has two potential suppliers, namely Supplier S and Supplier P, each offering different terms. For Supplier S, IKEA places an order of 5,000 units without any fixed charge, and the unit cost amounts to 120 euros per tent.

On the other hand, for Supplier P, IKEA needs to place a minimum initial order of 4,000 units, with the option to place a second order ranging from 0 to 6,000 units based on market conditions. Supplier P charges an upfront fixed cost of 100,000 euros, and the unit cost for each tent is 100 euros.

As part of the project, we will analyze and optimize the order quantities and supplier selections for IKEA's Krusbar tent, taking into account the uncertain demand and the various supplier options. The goal is to maximize profitability by making strategic decisions on order quantities and supplier choices to meet customer demand effectively. By utilizing simulation and optimization techniques, we aim to provide valuable insights to IKEA for making informed business decisions and achieving the highest possible profit margins for the Krusbar tent.



Based on our rigorous calculations and analysis, it becomes evident that regardless of the demand's strength, IKEA's most advantageous supplier choice for the Krusbar gazebo tent is Supplier P. Our data-driven approach reveals that Supplier P offers the optimal solution, ensuring profitability and efficiency in all market conditions.
